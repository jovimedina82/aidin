# Session Changes Summary
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Tasks Completed:** Staff Directory Improvements & Azure AD Sync Fix

---

## 1. Staff Directory - "My Schedule" Button

### File Modified: `/opt/apps/Aidin/app/staff-directory/page.js`

**What it does:**
- Added a prominent "My Schedule" button at the top of the Staff Directory page
- This button allows staff members to quickly access and manage their own schedules
- Previously, staff had to scroll through the directory to find their own card and click "View Schedule"

**Changes:**
- Lines 267-297: Added "My Schedule" button in the header
- Lines 273-275: Updated page description to guide users

**User Impact:**
- Staff like Cathleen McNally can now easily add and manage their work schedules
- One-click access to personal schedule instead of searching for their own card
- Improves user experience and makes schedule management more intuitive

## 2. Azure AD Synchronization Fix

### File Modified: `/opt/apps/Aidin/.env`

**What it does:**
- Enabled automatic Azure AD user synchronization
- Syncs users from the "IT-Helpdesk" Azure AD group every 30 minutes
- Automatically creates/updates user accounts with information from Azure AD
- Downloads and updates user profile photos

**Changes Added:**
```bash
AZURE_SYNC_ENABLED=true
AZURE_SYNC_DEV_MODE=true
```

**What the sync does:**
- Connects to Azure AD IT-Helpdesk group
- Fetches 100 users from the group
- Creates new user accounts or updates existing ones
- Syncs: name, email, job title, office location, phone numbers
- Downloads profile photos from Azure AD
- Assigns "Requester" role to new users
- Runs automatically every 30 minutes
- Creates audit log entries for compliance

**User Impact:**
- User accounts stay synchronized with Azure AD automatically
- New employees are automatically added to the helpdesk system
- Profile information stays up-to-date
- Profile photos are automatically updated
- IT admins don't need to manually create/update accounts
