# 🤖 Enhanced AI Features - Complete Implementation Guide

## 🎯 What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Ticket Categorization & Priority Setting
- **Advanced AI categorization** with department-specific adjustments
- **Confidence scoring** for categorization decisions
- **Keyword-based fallback** when AI is unavailable
- **Priority boost logic** based on department requirements

### 2. Department-Based Routing with Keyword Dictionaries + AI Context
- **4 departments** set up with comprehensive keyword dictionaries:
  - **IT**: 30+ keywords (computer, laptop, email, wifi, security, etc.)
  - **Accounting**: 16+ keywords (billing, invoice, payment, budget, etc.)
  - **HR**: 15+ keywords (employee, benefits, payroll, training, etc.)
  - **Sales**: 14+ keywords (customer, crm, lead, contract, etc.)
- **Two-phase routing**:
  - Phase 1: Keyword matching with weighted scoring
  - Phase 2: AI context analysis when keyword matching is unclear
- **Confidence thresholds** for routing decisions

### 3. Knowledge Base-Driven AI Responses
- **3 knowledge base articles** with embeddings generated
- **Semantic search** using OpenAI embeddings
- **Context-aware responses** that reference KB articles
- **Usage tracking** for KB effectiveness
- **Fallback responses** when no relevant KB found

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```
DepartmentKeyword - Stores keywords with weights for each department
KnowledgeBase - Articles with embeddings for semantic search
TicketKBUsage - Tracks which KB articles are used for tickets
AIDecision - Records AI routing decisions for analysis
```

### AI Service Layer
```
lib/ai/
├── routing.js - Department routing logic
├── categorization.js - Enhanced ticket categorization
├── knowledge-search.js - KB search with embeddings
└── response-generation.js - Enhanced response generation
```

## 🧪 How to Test the System

### Test 1: IT Department Routing
Create a ticket with:
- **Title**: "Password reset needed"
- **Description**: "I can't login to my computer, need password reset"
- **Expected**: Routes to IT department, gets KB-based response

### Test 2: Accounting Department Routing
Create a ticket with:
- **Title**: "Invoice processing question"
- **Description**: "How do I process vendor invoices in the system?"
- **Expected**: Routes to Accounting department, gets relevant KB response

### Test 3: Complex AI Analysis
Create a ticket with:
- **Title**: "Employee computer setup for new hire"
- **Description**: "Need to set up laptop and email for new sales person"
- **Expected**: AI analyzes context, routes to IT (not Sales), high priority

### Test 4: Knowledge Base Integration
Create a ticket with:
- **Title**: "Printer not working"
- **Description**: "Office printer won't print, shows error"
- **Expected**: Gets response with specific troubleshooting steps from KB

## 📊 Monitoring AI Decisions

### Database Queries to Check AI Performance

```sql
-- Check AI routing decisions
SELECT
  t.title,
  t.category,
  t.priority,
  d.name as department,
  ai.departmentConfidence,
  ai.routingMethod,
  ai.keywordMatches,
  ai.aiReasoning
FROM tickets t
LEFT JOIN departments d ON t.departmentId = d.id
LEFT JOIN ai_decisions ai ON t.id = ai.ticketId
ORDER BY t.createdAt DESC;

-- Check knowledge base usage
SELECT
  kb.title,
  kb.usageCount,
  COUNT(tku.id) as ticket_references
FROM knowledge_base kb
LEFT JOIN ticket_kb_usage tku ON kb.id = tku.kbId
GROUP BY kb.id
ORDER BY kb.usageCount DESC;

-- Check department keyword effectiveness
SELECT
  d.name,
  COUNT(dk.id) as keyword_count,
  COUNT(t.id) as tickets_routed
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN department_keywords dk ON d.id = dk.departmentId
LEFT JOIN tickets t ON d.id = t.departmentId
GROUP BY d.id;
```

## 🔧 Management & Administration

### Adding New Keywords
```javascript
await prisma.departmentKeyword.create({
  data: {
    departmentId: "department-uuid",
    keyword: "new-keyword",
    weight: 1.5
  }
});
```

### Adding New Knowledge Base Articles
```javascript
await prisma.knowledgeBase.create({
  data: {
    title: "Article Title",
    content: "Detailed content...",
    tags: JSON.stringify(["tag1", "tag2"]),
    departmentId: "department-uuid"
  }
});

// Generate embedding
await updateKnowledgeBaseEmbeddings();
```

### Viewing AI Decision Analytics
```javascript
// Get routing accuracy
const decisions = await prisma.aIDecision.findMany({
  include: { ticket: true }
});

// Analyze confidence scores
const avgConfidence = decisions.reduce((sum, d) => sum + d.departmentConfidence, 0) / decisions.length;
```

## 🎮 Admin Scripts Available
