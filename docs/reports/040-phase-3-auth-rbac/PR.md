# Phase 3: Auth & RBAC Implementation

This PR implements real authentication middleware and role-based access control in the feature modules created during Phase 2. Includes JWT token helpers, authentication guards, RBAC permission matrix, and refactored exemplar routes (GET /api/auth/me, POST /api/tickets).

All existing routes continue to function unchanged. New middleware is opt-in and demonstrates the pattern for future migrations. Comprehensive test suite validates authentication flows, permission checks, and resource ownership rules.

**Status**: 67/67 tests passing, 45/45 routes building, zero breaking changes.
