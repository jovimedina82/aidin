The AI engineer successfully built a Zendesk-like IT helpdesk, addressing numerous features and bugs. Initial work focused on an advanced  system, integrating user suggestion and profile modals (, , ). This involved extensive refactoring and meticulous deduplication logic, including role prioritization and strict role-based access for suggestions. Concurrently, a comprehensive reporting dashboard was developed (), featuring six key performance indicators (KPIs) like ticket trends, agent performance, and priority distribution. This required creating new backend API endpoints () and frontend chart integration using . Admin user management () was also implemented, enabling CRUD operations for users, role assignment, and bulk deletion, alongside agent-specific user management () with granular permissions. Throughout the trajectory, the engineer iteratively debugged and fixed critical issues: s due to null references (, ), incorrect dashboard statistics, faulty ticket escalation, and persistent frontend blank screens often masking successful backend fixes. The last task involved implementing Excel export for reports and dynamic filtering.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is a self-hosted IT helpdesk platform, akin to Zendesk. Key functionalities include comprehensive ticket management (web/email intake, triage, assignment, comments, attachments, views), a knowledge base, robust Role-Based Access Control (Requester, Agent, Admin), automations, audit logging, and basic reporting. The tech stack is Next.js, Prisma (SQLite), Tailwind/shadcn/ui, Node.js, and LLM integration. Development prioritized local authentication, core ticket management, fixing 404s, dashboard wiring, granular RBAC (Admin: full control; Agent: manage tickets, internal/public replies; Requester: create/view own tickets), UI hiding, backend access blocking, and email intake. Recent enhancements include Zendesk-style ticket status (, , , ), Take it!/ Take Over buttons, an  system with user invitations and profile modals, a comprehensive reporting dashboard with charts, and admin/agent user management (CRUD, role changes, bulk delete, permissions). The current work further refined report exports to Excel and added filtering capabilities.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on enhancing the reports dashboard. Specifically, the task was to implement **Excel export functionality with charts** and activate the **filter options** for analytics data.

The engineer successfully installed the  library and integrated it into  to enable downloading report data as an Excel file. This involved creating an  function that formats the various chart datasets (ticket trends, agent performance, etc.) into a workbook.

Concurrently, a filter system was implemented, adding state management for filter parameters (, , , , ). A filter dialog component was created in  to allow users to select these filters. The  function was updated to send these filter parameters to the backend, and the  endpoint was modified to process them in its analytics queries.

Backend testing for these features passed with a 96.8% success rate, confirming that both Excel export and dynamic filtering functionality are working as intended on the backend. However, the frontend  page still presents a white/blank screen, indicating an ongoing frontend rendering or authentication issue, despite the backend success.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and resolve the persistent frontend white/blank screen issue on the  page and ensure all charts render correctly.
