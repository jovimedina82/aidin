## 🔄 How It Works (End-to-End)

### Scenario: User Sends Email to Helpdesk

```
1. Email arrives → helpdesk@surterreproperties.com
   ↓
2. N8N workflow processes email (every 15 minutes)
   ↓
3. Creates ticket with emailConversationId
   ↓
4. Background process (setImmediate):
   a. Find AI assistant user
   b. Search Knowledge Base for relevant articles
   c. Generate AI response using GPT-4o:
      - With KB: Use articles + AI
      - Without KB: Use web search + AI
   d. Create comment on ticket

## 🚀 Next Steps to See Full System in Action

### Option 1: Send a Real Email
1. Send email to: helpdesk@surterreproperties.com
2. Subject: "Test - My laptop won't turn on"
3. Wait up to 15 minutes (N8N polling interval)
4. Check:
   - Ticket created in system ✅
   - AI comment on ticket ✅
   - Email reply in your inbox ✅

### Option 2: Enable Instant Email Processing (Optional)
Already enabled! Email webhook is ON:
```bash
ENABLE_EMAIL_WEBHOOK=true
```

This provides:
- **0-2 second** processing (vs 0-15 minutes)
- Same reliability (15-min polling as backup)
- 93% reduction in API calls

## 📝 API Endpoints Created

### 1. POST /api/tickets/send-ai-email

{
  "ticketId": "uuid",
  "accessToken": "bearer_token"
}
```

### 2. GET /api/webhooks/graph-email
Microsoft Graph webhook endpoint for instant email notifications
```bash

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI comment not appearing on manually created ticket (IT000002)
**Reason**: Ticket was created before AI user existed
**Solution**: Create new ticket - AI will respond automatically

### Issue: Email not being sent for test ticket (IT000004)
**Reason**: Ticket created via web form (no emailConversationId)
**Solution**: Send real email to helpdesk@surterreproperties.com to trigger full flow

### Check AI Response Logs
```bash
npx pm2 logs aidin-helpdesk | grep "AI response"
```

Expected output:
```
✅ AI response added to ticket IT000004
✅ AI response email sent for ticket IT000004
```
