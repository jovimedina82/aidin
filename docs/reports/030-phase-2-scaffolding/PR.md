# Phase 2: Feature Module Scaffolding

This PR creates the foundational scaffolding for 7 feature modules following Domain-Driven Design principles. Each module includes complete TypeScript interfaces, domain types, and service stubs that establish the architecture for Phase 3 implementation. The scaffolding is purely structural with zero runtime impact - all existing 45 routes continue to build and function normally.

All repository interfaces are defined without Prisma imports, maintaining clean separation of concerns. Service functions throw descriptive NotImplemented errors that reference Phase 3, making it clear which features require implementation. The comprehensive test suite validates all module exports and ensures proper typing across the codebase.

**Status**: 30/30 tests passing, build successful, zero breaking changes.
