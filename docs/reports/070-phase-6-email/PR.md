# Phase 6: Email Provider Abstraction & Safe Wiring

Implements secure email provider abstraction with constant-time webhook validation. Refactored webhook endpoint to use `modules/email` for validation (Phase 0.1 security requirement). Established pluggable provider interface for future SMTP/Graph implementations.

**Status**: 131/131 tests passing, 45/45 routes building, zero breaking changes, constant-time comparison implemented.
