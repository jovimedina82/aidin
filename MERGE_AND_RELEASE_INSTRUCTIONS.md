## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### Merge Conflicts

**If merge conflicts appear**:

1. **DO NOT merge** - resolve conflicts first
2. Checkout `release/rc1` branch locally:
   ```bash
   git checkout release/rc1
   git pull origin release/rc1
   ```
3. Merge main into release/rc1:
   ```bash
   git merge main
   ```
4. Resolve conflicts in affected files
5. Commit resolution:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve merge conflicts with main"
   ```
6. Push updated branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin release/rc1
   ```
7. Return to GitHub PR and verify conflicts resolved
8. Proceed with merge steps

### CI Failures After Merge

**If CI fails on main after merge**:

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/jovimedina82/aidin/actions
2. Click on failing workflow run
3. Review error logs
4. Common fixes:
   - **Missing JWT_SECRET**: Add to GitHub Actions secrets
   - **Dependency issues**: Re-run workflow (may be transient)
   - **Test failures**: Check if environment-specific issues

### Tag Already Exists

**If tag v0.1.0 already exists**:

1. Check existing tag:
   ```bash
   git ls-remote --tags origin | grep v0.1.0
   ```
2. If wrong commit, delete and recreate:
   ```bash
   # Delete local tag
   git tag -d v0.1.0

   # Delete remote tag
   git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0

   # Recreate tag (see "Create Tag Locally" section)
   ```

### GitHub Release Not Published

**If release creation fails**:

1. Verify tag exists: https://github.com/jovimedina82/aidin/tags
2. If tag exists, try creating release again from existing tag:
   - Go to Releases ‚Üí Draft new release
   - Select existing tag `v0.1.0` from dropdown
   - Fill in release details
   - Publish release
