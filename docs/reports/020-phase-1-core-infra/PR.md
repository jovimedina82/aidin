# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

Establishes foundational infrastructure building blocks for the AIDIN Helpdesk system: centralized configuration validation, database client singleton, structured logging, and unified error handling patterns. This phase adds essential DevX improvements with minimal behavior changes.

**Key Changes:**
- Created `lib/config.ts` with Zod validation for required env vars (DATABASE_URL, APP_BASE_URL)
- Added `lib/db.ts` Prisma singleton to prevent connection pool exhaustion
- Implemented `lib/logger.ts` with Pino for structured logging
- Built `lib/errors.ts` with unified API error shape and `handleApi()` wrapper
- Refactored 2 routes as exemplars: `/api/auth/me` and `/api/tickets/[id]` (GET only)
- Added 19 unit tests (config validation + error handling)
- Updated `.env.example` with comprehensive documentation

**Testing:** All tests pass (19/19), build succeeds (45/45 routes), no breaking changes.
**Risk:** Low - minimal behavior changes, two routes refactored as proof-of-concept.
