# Fix: Email ConversationId Not Saved

## Problem
Email responses were not being sent to requesters because the `emailConversationId` field was NULL in the ticket database. This field is required by `EmailService.sendAIResponseEmail()` to reply to the original email thread.

## Root Cause
The n8n workflow was sending `messageId` but NOT `conversationId` when creating tickets via the API.

**n8n workflow** ("Build Ticket Payload" node):
```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE: Missing conversationId
const ticketPayload = {
  title: email.subject,
  description,
  requesterEmail: email.from?.emailAddress?.address,
  priority,
  source: 'email',
  _emailId: email.id,  // Only messageId, no conversationId
  _accessToken: accessToken
};
```

**n8n workflow** ("Create Ticket" node):
```json
// ❌ BEFORE: Not sending conversationId to API
{
  "title": "$json.title",
  "description": "$json.description",
  "requesterEmail": "$json.requesterEmail",
  "priority": "$json.priority",
  "source": "$json.source",
  "messageId": "$json._emailId"
  // Missing: emailConversationId
}
```

**Ticket creation API** (`/opt/apps/aidin/app/api/tickets/route.js` line 327):
```javascript
// API expects this field:
emailConversationId: data.emailConversationId || null
```

**EmailService** (`/opt/apps/aidin/lib/services/EmailService.js` line 33):
```javascript
// Service checks for this field and skips if missing:
if (!ticket.emailConversationId) {
  console.log('Ticket was not created from email, skipping email reply')
  return { skipped: true, reason: 'Not an email ticket' }
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated "Build Ticket Payload" Node
**File**: `/opt/apps/aidin/n8n-workflows/Email to Ticket - With Forward(1).json`

Added `_conversationId` to the ticket payload:
```javascript
// ✅ AFTER: Now includes conversationId
const ticketPayload = {
  title: email.subject,
  description,
  requesterEmail: email.from?.emailAddress?.address,
  priority,
  source: 'email',
  _emailId: email.id,
  _conversationId: email.conversationId,  // ✅ ADDED
  _accessToken: accessToken
};
```

### 2. Updated "Create Ticket" Node
**File**: `/opt/apps/aidin/n8n-workflows/Email to Ticket - With Forward(1).json`

Added `emailConversationId` to the API request:
```json
// ✅ AFTER: Now sends conversationId to API
{
  "title": "$json.title",
  "description": "$json.description",
  "requesterEmail": "$json.requesterEmail",
  "priority": "$json.priority",
  "source": "$json.source",
  "messageId": "$json._emailId",
  "emailConversationId": "$json._conversationId"  // ✅ ADDED
}
```

### 3. Imported Workflow and Restarted n8n
```bash
bash /opt/apps/aidin/scripts/import-n8n-workflows.sh
docker compose restart n8n
```

## Impact

### ✅ Future Tickets (After Fix)
- All new tickets created from emails will have `emailConversationId` saved
- Staff can send AI responses and requesters will receive emails
- Email threading will work properly

### ❌ Existing Tickets (Before Fix)
- Tickets created before this fix (like IT000033) will still have NULL `emailConversationId`
- These tickets CANNOT send email replies
- Workaround: Staff can copy the AI response and manually email the requester

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Send a test email** to helpdesk@surterreproperties.com
2. **Wait for n8n** to process and create ticket
3. **Check the ticket** in database:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 /opt/apps/aidin/prisma/dev.db \
     "SELECT ticketNumber, title, emailConversationId FROM tickets ORDER BY createdAt DESC LIMIT 1;"
   ```
4. **Verify** `emailConversationId` is NOT NULL
5. **Open the ticket** in helpdesk UI
6. **Edit AI draft** if needed
7. **Send to requester**
8. **Verify email** is received by requester

Expected result: Email should be sent successfully with ticket number in subject: `[Ticket #IT000XXX]`

## Monitoring

Check if emails are being sent successfully:
```bash
# Check helpdesk logs for email sending
npx pm2 logs aidin-helpdesk | grep -i "email.*sent"

# Check for skipped emails
npx pm2 logs aidin-helpdesk | grep -i "skipping email reply"

# Verify conversationId is being saved
sqlite3 /opt/apps/aidin/prisma/dev.db \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) as total,
          COUNT(emailConversationId) as with_conversation_id
   FROM tickets
   WHERE source = 'email'
   AND createdAt >= datetime('now', '-1 day');"
```
