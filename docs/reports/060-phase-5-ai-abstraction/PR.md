# Phase 5: AI Provider Abstraction

Implements pluggable AI provider layer allowing swappable backends (OpenAI â†” Anthropic) without touching feature code. Includes real OpenAI implementation, Anthropic stub, and thin orchestration API (classify/respond). All existing AI call sites can now use modules/ai instead of direct SDK calls.

**Status**: 102/102 tests passing, 45/45 routes building, zero breaking changes, ready for refactoring existing call sites.
