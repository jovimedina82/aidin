# AI Draft Response - Enhanced Features

## Overview
The AI Draft Response system has been enhanced with two powerful new features to improve knowledge management and content richness.

## Feature A: Automatic KB Article Creation from Edited Drafts

### Description
When a user edits an AI-generated draft response and sends it to the requester, the system automatically creates a Knowledge Base article from the improved content.

### How It Works
1. User receives an AI-generated draft response for a ticket
2. User clicks "Edit" to modify the draft
3. User makes improvements (adds details, fixes errors, uploads images/PDFs)
4. User clicks "Send to Requester"
5. **Automatically**: System creates a KB article with the edited content
6. The KB article includes all inline images and PDFs that were added

### Benefits
- **Continuous Learning**: The knowledge base grows automatically as agents improve AI responses
- **Quality Content**: Only validated, human-reviewed content enters the KB
- **Zero Friction**: No extra steps required - happens automatically when sending responses
- **Complete Context**: All images and PDFs are preserved in the KB article

### Configuration
- **Auto-save to KB**: Toggle checkbox in the draft editor (enabled by default)
- **KB Title**: Uses the ticket title by default
- **Tags**: Uses the ticket category by default
- **Manual Override**: Users can still manually save to KB with custom title/tags

### Example Workflow
```
1. Ticket: "How do I reset my password?"
   AI Draft: Basic password reset steps

2. Agent edits draft:
   - Adds screenshot of login page
   - Adds PDF with detailed instructions
   - Clarifies specific steps for different user types

3. Agent sends response → KB article created automatically:
   Title: "How do I reset my password?"
   Content: Enhanced response with images and PDF
   Tags: [Authentication, Password, Account]
```

## Feature B: Inline Image and PDF Support

### Description
Users can now add both images AND PDF files directly inline in the body of AI-generated drafts.

### Supported File Types
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG
- **PDFs**: Adobe PDF documents
- **Max Size**: 10MB per file

### How to Use

#### Adding Files
1. Click "Edit" on an AI draft response
2. Click "Add Image/PDF" button
3. Select an image or PDF file from your computer
4. File uploads and is inserted at cursor position

#### Inline Display
- **Images**: Display inline with markdown `![filename](url)`
- **PDFs**: Show as downloadable link with 📎 icon: `📎 [filename](url)`

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Position cursor where you want to insert the file
- Click "Add Image/PDF"
- File is inserted at cursor position automatically

### File Storage
- Files are stored in: `/public/uploads/draft-files/[ticketId]/`
- Each ticket has its own directory
- Files are publicly accessible via URL
- Original filenames are preserved (sanitized)

### KB Integration
When a draft with inline files is saved to KB (automatically or manually):
- All image URLs are preserved
- All PDF links are preserved
- Files remain accessible in the KB article
- Future tickets can reference the same resources

### Example Use Cases

#### Technical Support with Screenshots
```markdown

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (AIDraftReview.jsx)
- Added `wasEdited` state to track if draft was modified
- Added `autoSaveToKB` toggle (enabled by default)
- Updated file upload to support both images and PDFs
- Automatic KB creation triggers on "Send to Requester" if edited

### Backend (upload-draft-file/route.js)
- New endpoint: `/api/tickets/[id]/upload-draft-file`
- Validates file type (images and PDFs only)
- Validates file size (max 10MB)
- Creates ticket-specific upload directories
- Returns public URL for inline embedding

### Storage Structure
```
/public/uploads/draft-files/
  ├── [ticket-id-1]/
  │   ├── network-diagram-1234567890.png
  │   ├── setup-manual-1234567891.pdf
  │   └── led-indicator-1234567892.jpg
  ├── [ticket-id-2]/
  │   └── troubleshooting-guide-1234567893.pdf
  └── README.md
```

### Security Considerations
- File type validation on both client and server
- File size limits to prevent abuse
- Sanitized filenames to prevent path traversal
- Files scoped to specific tickets
- Authentication required for upload

```

### Auto-Save Notification
When sending an edited draft:
```
✓ Response sent successfully
✨ KB article created: How to reset your password
```

---

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Auto-Save
Users can toggle the "Auto-save to KB" checkbox in the draft editor:
- **Checked (default)**: Edited drafts automatically create KB articles
- **Unchecked**: Draft is sent but not saved to KB

### Customize KB Article
Users can click "Save to KB" button to manually configure:
- Custom article title
- Custom tags
- Preview content before saving

---

## Best Practices

### For Agents
1. **Always add visuals**: Screenshots make responses clearer
2. **Include documentation**: Attach PDF manuals when relevant
3. **Edit thoughtfully**: Your edits become KB articles
4. **Use descriptive names**: Rename files before uploading for clarity

### For Admins
1. **Review KB periodically**: Check auto-generated articles for quality
2. **Monitor storage**: Large files can accumulate over time
3. **Train agents**: Show them how to use inline files effectively
4. **Set expectations**: Let agents know their edits create KB content

---

## Troubleshooting

### File upload fails
- Check file size (must be < 10MB)
- Verify file type (images or PDF only)
- Ensure user is authenticated

### Images don't display in KB
- Verify file URL is accessible
- Check file wasn't deleted from uploads directory
- Confirm markdown syntax is correct

### KB article not created automatically
- Verify "Auto-save to KB" checkbox is enabled
- Ensure draft was actually edited (wasEdited=true)
- Check browser console for errors

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- Support for more file types (Word, Excel)
- Image compression/optimization
- File deduplication
- Batch file upload
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Image editing tools (crop, resize)
- PDF preview in-line
- File versioning

---

## Summary

These two features work together to create a powerful knowledge management system:

1. **Agents improve AI responses** with images and PDFs
2. **System automatically captures improvements** in the KB
3. **Future tickets benefit** from enhanced, validated content
4. **Knowledge base grows organically** with zero friction

The result: Better responses, better documentation, and continuous improvement of the AI system.
