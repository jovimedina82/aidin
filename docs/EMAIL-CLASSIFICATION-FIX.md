# Email Classification Fix - October 6, 2025

## Issue
Email with subject "Password change every 6 month" was being classified as "unclear" instead of "support".

## Root Cause
The N8N email classifier was requiring explicit help-seeking language ("please help", "can you", etc.) and didn't recognize IT-related topics without action verbs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added IT Topics Detection
Added regex pattern to detect IT-related keywords:
```javascript
itTopics: /\b(password|mfa|multi[\-\s]?factor|2fa|account|login|access|permission|software|hardware|printer|email|wifi|wi[\-\s]?fi|vpn|computer|laptop|device|setup|install|update|security|policy|reset|unlock|lockout|expire)\b/i
```

### 2. Updated Classification Logic
Added IT topics signal to heuristics:
```javascript
hints: {
  signals: {
    // ... existing signals ...
    itTopics: rx.itTopics.test(SUBJECT) || rx.itTopics.test(BODY)
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced AI Prompt with KEY RULE
Updated the system prompt to prioritize IT-related content:

**Decision priority (in order):**
1) **IT-RELATED TOPICS**: passwords, MFA, accounts, access, permissions, software, hardware, email, Wi-Fi, VPN, printers, devices, security, policies, setup → **support**
2) HUMAN INTENT: if a person is asking/mentioning/inquiring about IT → support
3) HELP-SEEKING LANGUAGE: "please help", "can you", "i need", "how do i", "i can't", "not working", "issue", "error" → support
4) AUTOMATED PATTERNS: "do not reply", "no-reply", "verify your email", etc. → vendor
5) DOMAIN: company domain suggests support, but content wins

**KEY RULE**: If the message mentions IT topics (passwords, accounts, access, software, systems, policies, MFA, security) → ALWAYS classify as support, even if not explicitly asking for help.

### 4. Added Specific Examples
```
- "Password change every 6 months" → support (IT policy/security topic)
- "My password expired" → support (IT access issue)
- "How do I reset MFA?" → support (IT help question)
- "Printer not working" → support (IT hardware issue)
```

## Files Modified

### N8N Database
- **Workflow**: "Workflow Email Helpdesk" (ID: Qy2QbV1ADvFodFEP)
- **Node Updated**: "Build AI Request" (ID: f49c8aaf-f33e-4bcc-84d9-ea59f39a8133)
- **Changes**: Updated JavaScript code with IT topics detection and enhanced AI prompt

### Additional Changes
- **Polling Interval**: Changed from 1 minute to 15 minutes (as part of hybrid webhook strategy)
- **Scheduler Node**: Renamed from "Every 1 Minute" to "Every 15 Minutes"

## Testing
To verify the fix works:

1. Send email to helpdesk@surterreproperties.com with subject: "Password change every 6 months"
2. Wait up to 15 minutes for N8N to process
3. Verify ticket is classified as "support" (not "unclear")

## Expected Behavior

### Now Classified as "support":
- "Password change every 6 months"
- "Account expiration policy"
- "MFA setup"
- "VPN access question"
- "Printer configuration"
- "Software installation"
- "Email forwarding"
- "Wi-Fi password"

### Still Classified as "vendor":
- "Your verification code is 123456"
- "Newsletter: New Products!"
- "Invoice #12345"
- "Out of office auto-reply"
- "Meeting invitation"

### Still Classified as "unclear":
- "Thanks!" (no IT context)
- "FYI" (no IT context)
- Generic messages with no clear IT topic or help request

## Deployment
- **Date**: October 6, 2025
- **Applied to**: Production N8N instance (aidin-n8n-1)
- **Status**: ✅ Active
- **Restart Required**: Yes (completed)

## Notes
- The classifier now recognizes IT topics even when the email doesn't explicitly ask for help
- Domain is still considered, but content always wins
- Heuristics provide signals to the AI model but don't force classification
- Final decision is always made by GPT-3.5-turbo with temperature 0.0 for consistency
