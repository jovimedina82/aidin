# Email Auto-Reply System - Complete Fix
**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed and Deployed

---

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Email Classification - "Password change every 6 month" classified as "unclear"

**Root Cause**: N8N email classifier required explicit help-seeking language and didn't recognize IT-related topics without action verbs.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Added IT topics regex detection in Build AI Request node
2. Updated AI classification prompt with KEY RULE prioritizing IT topics
3. Changed polling interval from 1 minute to 15 minutes

**Files Modified**:
- N8N Database: Workflow "Workflow Email Helpdesk" (ID: Qy2QbV1ADvFodFEP)
  - Node: "Build AI Request" (ID: f49c8aaf-f33e-4bcc-84d9-ea59f39a8133)
  - Node: "Every 1 Minute" ‚Üí "Every 15 Minutes" (polling scheduler)

**Result**: ‚úÖ IT-related emails now correctly classified as "support"

---

### Issue 2: Prisma Validation Error - "Unknown field department"

**Root Cause**: Knowledge Base search was trying to include non-existent `department` relation.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Removed `department: true` from prisma.knowledgeBase.findMany() query
2. Removed `article.department?.name` reference from response mapping

**Files Modified**:
- `/opt/apps/aidin/lib/ai/knowledge-search.js`
  - Line 25-27: Removed include clause
  - Line 38-45: Removed department from returned object

**Result**: ‚úÖ AI response generation no longer crashes

---

### Issue 3: Email Replies Not Being Sent

**Root Cause**: N8N workflow was NOT including `emailConversationId` when creating tickets from emails. Without this field, the helpdesk system cannot send reply emails.

**What Was Missing**:
The N8N workflow creates tickets via POST to `/api/tickets` but was only sending:
```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "requesterEmail": "...",
  "priority": "...",
  "source": "email"
}
```

Missing: `emailConversationId`

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Build Ticket Payload node** - Added `conversationId` to ticket payload
2. **Create Ticket node** - Updated JSON body to include `emailConversationId: $json.conversationId`

**N8N Database Changes**:
- Node: "Build Ticket Payload" (ID: 04a13a15-17c6-4669-8c49-aba53851db9d)
  - Added: `conversationId: email.conversationId ?? null`

- Node: "Create Ticket" (ID: c20ad11d-26a5-4b42-b48e-88b7ecb2d13d)
  - Changed: `emailConversationId: $json.conversationId`

**Result**: ‚úÖ New tickets from email will include conversationId, enabling email replies

## How Email Auto-Reply Works Now

### Flow for Email ‚Üí Ticket ‚Üí AI Response ‚Üí Email Reply

```
1. Email arrives ‚Üí helpdesk@surterreproperties.com
   ‚Üì
2. N8N polls every 15 minutes (or webhook triggers instantly)
   ‚Üì
3. AI classifies email:
   - IT topics (password, MFA, access, etc.) ‚Üí "support" ‚úÖ
   - Automated (OTP, newsletter, etc.) ‚Üí "vendor"
   - Ambiguous ‚Üí "unclear"
   ‚Üì
4. If "support":
   a. N8N creates ticket with:
      - title, description, requesterEmail, priority
      - emailConversationId ‚Üê THIS WAS MISSING! ‚úÖ FIXED
   ‚Üì
5. Helpdesk API creates ticket:
   a. Finds AI assistant user
   b. Searches Knowledge Base
   c. Generates AI response with GPT-4o
   d. Saves comment to ticket
   e. IF emailConversationId exists:
      ‚Üí Sends email reply via Microsoft Graph ‚úÖ
   ‚Üì
6. User receives helpful AI response in their inbox (0-15 min)
```

## Verification Steps

### For New Email Tickets:
1. Send email to: helpdesk@surterreproperties.com
2. Subject: "Password change question" or similar IT topic
3. Wait up to 15 minutes (N8N polling)
4. Check:
   - ‚úÖ Ticket created and classified as "support"
   - ‚úÖ AI comment appears on ticket
   - ‚úÖ Email reply sent to requester's inbox

### Database Check:
```sql
SELECT ticketNumber, title, emailConversationId, createdAt
FROM tickets
WHERE emailConversationId IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY createdAt DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Before Fix**: `emailConversationId` column was NULL/empty
**After Fix**: `emailConversationId` contains Microsoft Graph conversationId
